                I've always sought out opprtunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns - from manual testing to enterprise quality architect. I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.

                As a web developer and quality architect, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to make a difference.
